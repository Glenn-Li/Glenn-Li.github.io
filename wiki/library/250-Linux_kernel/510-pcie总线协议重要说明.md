就是想记多少就记多少，不记拉倒。。。

心塞，中文版的 pdf 没有办法复制，看来只能看中文版，有需要摘录的时候就复制英文版了。 Sounds great!

## 体系结果展望

主要论述PCI-EXPRESS 链路的性能优势及其主要特点。

### Introduction To PCI Express

PCI Express is the third generation high performance I/O bus used to interconnect peripheral devices in applications such as computing and communication
platforms.

第一代I/O总线：ISA, EISA, VESA, and Micro Channel

第一代I/O总线：PCI, AGP, and PCI-X

PCI Express is an all encompassing I/O device interconnect bus that has applications in the mobile, desktop, workstation, server, embedded computing and
communication platforms.

### The Role of the Original PCI Solution

PCI Express employs the same usage model and load-store communication model as PCI and PCI-X. PCI Express supports familiar transactions
such as memory read/write, IO read/write and configuration read/write transactions. The memory, IO and configuration address space model is the same as
PCI and PCI-X address spaces.
