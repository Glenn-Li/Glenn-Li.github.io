**搭配过去进行时的 'When' 从句**

用过去进行时描述动作在某一个时间正在进行，一个含有一般过去时的when 从句用来表达动作被打断。
 
    I was writing an email when the phone rang.	我正在写邮件，这时电话铃响了。
    I was taking a shower when someone knocked on the door.	我正在洗澡，这时有人敲门。

**Giving details and examples 提供细节和例子**

写下主题句后，提供支持主题句的细节和例子。细节和例子可以帮助你清楚地表达主题的意思，同时读者也可能会觉得它们很有意思。

    swimming
    8 years old
    incredibly tall
    taller than others
    asked a question
    an orange swim cap
    a purple mouth
    laughed

    My Best Friend Natasha

    I first met my best friend when we were swimming at summer camp. We were 8 years old. Natasha was incredibly tall. She was taller than all the other children. She asked me a question: 'Why are you wearing that orange swim cap?' So I asked her: 'Why are you so tall?' Natasha laughed. Her mouth was purple from eating strange candy. I laughed, too.

    I first met my colleague, John, when we were studying at Duke University. He walked into my room, said hello, and then we started talking about history together. John looks like one of those little people in 'Lord of the Rings,' with funny ears. He always has a smile in his eyes. He also tells crazy stories. He has one story about playing the flute in New Orleans. He was playing on the street when a river of water came down the street. He ran! In the end, both John and I got hired by BTC. Now he's an old friend.
