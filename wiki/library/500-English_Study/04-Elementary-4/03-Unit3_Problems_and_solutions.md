### 谈论问题

**在确定一个问题后，你可能想详细加以解释。以下是一些帮助你进行解释的表达。**

	She can't quit smoking. One big problem is that her husband smokes, too.	 	她戒不了烟。一个大问题是她的丈夫也抽烟。

**that可省略而不会造成意义的改变。**

	He is very overweight. The trouble is he eats too much chocolate.	 	他非常胖。问题是他吃太多巧克力了。
	She can't quit smoking. One big problem is her husband smokes, too.	 	她戒不了烟。一个大问题是她的丈夫也抽烟。

## Part 2:Giving your friend advice

	I know that smoking is really bad for me. I really need to give it up.
	He wants to lose weight, so he's going to begin exercising more.
	She wants to stop drinking coffee, but it's really hard to break the habit.
	When did they start having financial problems?

	You really should quit eating so much salt. It's bad for you.

### 情态动词 'ought to'和'had better'

	He's very overweight. He ought to lose some weight.	他很胖，应该减减肥。
	Your health is very poor. You had better quit smoking.	你身体很不好，最好把烟戒了。

## Part 3:Solving a employee problem

### 工作问题

	being late = tardiness	迟到
	being disorganized	缺乏条理的
	being lazy	懒惰
	being sloppy	粗心

### 'who' 引导的关系从句

**用关系从句连接两个句子。关系从句使您的写作和讲话更流利，并帮助您避免重复。关系代词 who 用来指人。**

	We have a lot of engineers. The engineers work late.                  
	We have a lot of engineers who work late.

**在例子中，主句We have a lot of engineers 是一个完整的句子。关系从句who work late不是一个完整的句子，故不能独立成句。**

## Part 4: Proposing a soolution to a work issue

### 公司问题

**我们在生活和工作中都会碰到问题。学习其中一些常见的公司问题。**

	Business is bad, and employee morale is low.	生意很差，而且员工士气低落。

### 'that' 引导的关系从句

**用关系代词连接两个句子。用关系代词that 代替事物。**

	I work for a company. The company has lots of problems.
    I work for a company that has lots of problems.

**在该例子中，主句I work for a company 是一个完整句，关系从句that has lots of problems 不是完整句，故不能单独成句。**

**记住，使用关系从句可以让你的作文和讲话更流畅，避免重复。**
